# Prime Number Plot

I watched a 3blue1brown video on this and knew I had to try it
#
The images are massive but the basic premise is that when you start to plot regular whole numbers and prime numbers on polar coordinates, you begin to see "gaps" in the spirals, yes this has to do with multiples leaving, but more so with the actual radians being products of numbers that are not prime anymore
#
I formatted the code so that you can just download and replace the number in 'n' and see for yourself, I noticed that the actual plot limitations kick in after a while and the graphs look cooked (hence the massive reformatting I did) so be aware of that. Thanks for reading :-).
