# Electoral College

With the election passing by this week, I felt I had an opportunity to visit a concept that drove the nation mad 4 years ago - how could someone be chosen by an additional 2 million Americans and still lose? I pondered about who the electoral college really serves, and wanted to get an actual representation of just that.

Just a lil thing - Blue is for the Electoral Votes / Million residents and orange is % Makeup of Non-Hispanic Whites in the given state.
